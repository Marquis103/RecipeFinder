# RecipeFinder
RecipeFinder allows users to search for recipes.  The recipes return information such as ingredients, nutrition information and ingredients list to help users re-create their favorite or desired dishes.  Links to the original recipe are also available for more information.

###Getting Started
App is build using Swift 2.2, iOS 9 and XCode 7.  The application uses the Edamam API for searching recipes.  An AppKey and AppId must be obtained from them to be able to extend the functionality of the code.

###Known Issues
* Edamam API only returns a subset of some fields.
* Difficulty Level is currently not returned.
* Preparation and Cook Time are not returned.

###Needed Functionality
* Device side cache can be used to store images and recipes locally on device between application usage.
* Layout can be improved
* Capability to bookmark favorite recipes
